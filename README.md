## Hi there 👋

I don't have a particular favorite programming language; I appreciate what can be achieved with each of them. I'm a touche-à-tout who enjoys discovering new things.
I like open-source and libre projects ❤️

## 🚀 Projects 
🏠 I developed a Home Assistant integration that allows users to monitor and control their Comwatt devices, fetching real-time data and providing sensors for power consumption and production. 

📚 I created a Go library that implements the XAPI protocol, although it is not fully finished and does not implement all the API features due to time constraints. 

🐾 I reverse-engineered a pet feeder distributor's application to gain control without using their API, discovering weak default credentials and potential security risks in IoT devices. 

🔌 At Electra, I have been working for over 2 years, utilizing various technologies and gaining experience with multiple protocols in the EV industry, such as OCPP and OCPI. 

💅 During my 1 year and 3 months at Wecasa, I worked with Ruby On Rails, MySQL, Docker, Airbrake, NewRelic, and CircleCI to develop and maintain their web application. 

🌾 At Ekylibre, I spent 9 months contributing to the development of an open-source farm management software using Ruby On Rails, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, Docker, and Kibana. 

🖥️ Finally, at 42 Network, I worked for 5 months with Ruby On Rails, PostgreSQL, Django, Flask, JS, Docker, Sentry, and NewRelic on self-hosted servers to deliver solutions.
