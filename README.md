## 🚀 Projects 
🏠 Developed a [Home Assistant integration](https://github.com/MateoGreil/homeassistant-comwatt) that allows users to monitor and control their Comwatt devices, fetching real-time data and providing sensors for power consumption and production. 

📚 Created a [Go library](https://github.com/MateoGreil/xapi-go) that implements the XAPI protocol, although it is not fully finished and does not implement all the API features due to time constraints. 

🐾 [Reverse-engineered](https://github.com/MateoGreil/python-dvr/commit/822d07c2944394064bc2f02f02739d379773c6dd) a [pet feeder distributor's application](https://gist.github.com/MateoGreil/cd821a440e4b9e2cdc89a663e7038544) to gain control without using their API, and add this feature to an [open-source repo](https://github.com/OpenIPC/python-dvr).

🔌 At [Electra](https://github.com/Go-Electra/), worked for 3 years, utilizing various technologies and gaining experience with multiple protocols in the EV industry, such as OCPP, OPCP, OICP, OCPI, MQTT.

💅 During 1 year and few months at [Wecasa](https://github.com/wecasa/), worked with Ruby On Rails, MySQL, Docker, Airbrake, NewRelic, and CircleCI to develop and maintain their web application. 

🌾 At [Ekylibre](https://github.com/ekylibre/), spent 9 months contributing to the development of an open-source farm management software using Ruby On Rails, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, Docker, and Kibana. 

🖥️ At [42 Network](https://github.com/42-network), worked for 5 months with Ruby On Rails, PostgreSQL, Django, Flask, JS, Docker, Sentry, and NewRelic on self-hosted servers to deliver solutions.
